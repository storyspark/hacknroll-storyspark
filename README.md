<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<h3>Landing Page</h3>

[![Landing Page Gif][landing-gif]](https://gright-7442b.web.app/)

<h3>Background</h3>
In a world that continuously promotes innovation, there are still many who experience issues such as difficulties ideating or writer's block in creative writing, due to unfamiliarity with topics or a lack of inspiration. Thankfully, there are AI-generated tools that facilitate this process by closing the information gap such as chatGPT and copy.ai.

We in team Guerilla believe that more can be done to facilitate innovation, hence we developed StorySpark - a multipurpose collaborative storytelling tool for both people and businesses.

By feeding in a category and tone of your choice, as well as an image and story prompt, StorySpark generates a story that is unique to each individual, and will be published to the platform for others to view.
